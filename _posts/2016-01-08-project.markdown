[**Dog Vs Cat Classification**](https://github.com/murthy98/Dog_Vs_Cat_Classification)
``` ruby
	classify images cat or a dog with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).It is implemented using TensorFlow library.
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a system that can detect cats and dogs. While our goal is very specific (cats vs dogs), ImageClassifier can detect anything that is tangible with an adequate dataset.

```
[**Predecting Handwritten Digits**](https://github.com/murthy98/Predecting-Handwritten-Digits)
``` ruby
	By using this we can predict the handwritten digits(1,2,3....) by using MNIST dataset.It is also an image classification problem which is build using Pytorch Library.
```
[**Student Admissions**](https://github.com/murthy98/StudentAdmissions)
``` ruby
	By using this we can able to predict if the student get an admission in college or not.This was also build using Pytorch Library.

```
